# pycrystal
a small piece of code for crystal operation (especially 2D crystals)

## Functionalities:
1. Read/Write POSCAR, XYZ and CIF (CIF is only roughly supported, only P 1 space group is allowed)
2. Basic lattice operations, including rotation, periodic repeating and so on.
3. Merge structures, including building heterostructures and multilayers (for 2D materials).
4. Moire pattern, including building Moire sheet and Moire superlattice. (please cite: Tang, K. & Qi, W. Moiré‐Pattern‐Tuned Electronic Structures of van der Waals Heterostructures. Adv. Funct. Mater. 30, 2002672 (2020).)
